Here is a sample code in JavaScript that aims to simulate a virtual banking system. Please note that this code is purely for demonstration purposes and may not contain all the necessary functionality or error handling that a complete banking system should have.

```javascript
// File: virtual_banking.js
// Description: Simulates a virtual banking system

// Define Customer class
class Customer {
  constructor(name, accountNumber, balance = 0) {
    this.name = name;
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.balance = balance;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
    console.log(`$${amount.toFixed(2)} deposited successfully.`);
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (this.balance >= amount) {
      this.balance -= amount;
      console.log(`$${amount.toFixed(2)} withdrawn successfully.`);
    } else {
      console.log("Insufficient funds.");
    }
  }

  getBalance() {
    console.log(`Account Balance for ${this.name}: $${this.balance.toFixed(2)}`);
  }
}

// Create some customer instances
const customer1 = new Customer("John Doe", "1234567890");
const customer2 = new Customer("Jane Smith", "0987654321", 5000);

// Perform banking operations
customer1.getBalance(); // Output: Account Balance for John Doe: $0.00
customer2.getBalance(); // Output: Account Balance for Jane Smith: $5000.00

customer1.deposit(1000); // Output: $1000.00 deposited successfully.
customer2.withdraw(2000); // Output: $2000.00 withdrawn successfully.

customer1.getBalance(); // Output: Account Balance for John Doe: $1000.00
customer2.getBalance(); // Output: Account Balance for Jane Smith: $3000.00

customer1.withdraw(1500); // Output: $1500.00 withdrawn successfully.
customer2.deposit(2500); // Output: $2500.00 deposited successfully.

customer1.getBalance(); // Output: Account Balance for John Doe: $500.00
customer2.getBalance(); // Output: Account Balance for Jane Smith: $5500.00
```

This example demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, with the `Customer` class representing a banking customer. Each customer has a name, account number, and balance. The code simulates depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as retrieving the account balance for each customer.

Please note that for simplicity, the code uses `console.log()` for output instead of a graphical user interface or a proper transaction system.
